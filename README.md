# Static Narrative Service
---
## Introduction

This service is used for creating and managing Static Narratives. These are Narratives that are meant to be available for public viewing. They are:

1. Viewable anonymously through a shareable link.
2. Non-functional, in that they cannot execute jobs or check on job status.
3. Non-updateable, each given version of a Static Narrative is tied to a specific version of the original working Narrative that was used to create it.
4. Partially interactive, while some elements (mainly the App Cells) have most of their interactivity in common with the Narrative Interface, other visualizer cells do not, and link back to their Narrative.
